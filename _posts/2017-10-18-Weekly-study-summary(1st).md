## About CSS


1. Using BEM convention as possible.
> The point of BEM convention is *Decoupling the style, as far as possible without using the cascade selector. but `class`.*

2. The CSS attribute like `padding`,`margin` sometimes could achieve the same effect, but we should follow the semantic rules, just like HTML5 `aside`, `nav`...

3. Type less, do more. Using CSS box `flow` , `line-height` mechanism to build our layout. Similarly, reducing the accurate value using.

4. *Stylus*, *Less*, *Sass* supply `mixed`, `function` tool to reuse code.

## About debug

1. The steps are very important. I summed up the following steps
>1. Write all phenomenon of error, but not make a conclusion, not rigorous conclusion prevent us from discovering truth.

2. Google the all the keywords you can think of.(We are not supper man.)

3. If google doesn't provide help, close our eyes, image the work flow of code. Patiently, the problem will eventually be resolved.

4. Reflect, what knowledge is what we lack when we face this problem, master it!
