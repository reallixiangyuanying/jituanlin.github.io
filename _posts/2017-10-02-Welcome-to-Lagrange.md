## This blog is not...

* This blog is not a novice tutorial of coding. So we won't discuss some topic like *The todoMVC in React*.

* This blog is not some tool manual. So we won't discuss some topic like *Config babel to convert your javascript version*.

* This blog is not a authoritative guide. Maybe you will against my point of view, maybe something wrongly wrong(in this case,pls send a mail to me). But it's ok, because **the intention of this blog is discuss new idea, but the new idea maybe not a good idea**.
